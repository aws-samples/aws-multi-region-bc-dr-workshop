## LAB 3 - Preparing for Multi-Region Deployments

Moving to a multi-region application is no easy task. We need to not only make sure the infrastructure is available, but also the artifacts like Docker images, and then the application itself. In addition, the observability dashboards have to be updated to reflect multiple regions. Some logical things to think about are how do I understand the state of my application in both regions? How do I know when I need to failover into a secondary region? How do I test my secondary region deployment?

In this lab, you will begin preparations for moving your application to multiple regions. It's very common to forget a number of steps along the way as many people will mainly think of infrastructure and the application itself to move over, but there are a number of assets that also need to be referenced.

![Lab-3-Architecture](images/lab-3-arch.png)

These are the things that we will need to replicate and/or also automate:
* Infrastructure
  * Network
  * Docker Repositories
  * ECS resources (e.g. task definitions, services)
  * Monitoring
* Data tier
* Container images
* Application Deployment Pipeline
* Application(s)

### Instructions

### [1] Replicate infrastructure
At the beginning of the workshop, you used [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) to launch a stack and create the Lab-0 base infrastructure. We'll do the same thing now to replicate it, but we'll enter in a different parameter.

<details>
<summary>Learn more: AWS CloudFormation deployment options</summary>

What you are about to do is quite likely the simplest way of deploying another CloudFormation stack. You will run a CLI (Command Line Interface) command to deploy the same CloudFormation template into a different region. Specifically, we will be instructing CloudFormation to deploy into the us-east-1 region.

There are a number of different ways to achieve this, like using [AWS CloudFormation Stacksets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html) or using [AWS CodePipeline to trigger CloudFormation in a CI/CD pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/continuous-delivery-codepipeline.html). Both of these are a much more automated way of deploying into multiple regions, but for simplicity's sake, in this lab you will use the simplest method of using the CLI.
</details>

1. Navigate back to the [AWS Cloud9 console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9) and access your working environment. Run these commands:

    ```
    $ cd ~/environment/aws-multi-region-bc-dr-workshop
    $ aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name mm-secondary-region --template-file cfn/core.yml \
      --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND --parameter-overrides \
      IsSecondary=true --region us-east-1
    ```

<details>
   <summary>Learn more: What did you just do</summary>
   In Lab-0, we deployed a CloudFormation stack that had all the core components of the infrastructure, such as:

   * VPC (subnets, route tables, routes, etc)
   * ECS (task definitions, services, etc)
   * CICD Stack (AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild)

   What you just did was replicate a portion of that based on the `IsSecondary=true` flag. We set the flag to true this time to spin up some additional resources and not spin up others.
</details>

Once you see **Waiting for changeset to be created..Waiting for stack create/update to complete**, you can continue on. This doesn't mean the stack is done, but you can do the Database Replication portion in parallel. Check back later and make sure you see **Successfully created/updated stack - mm-secondary-region**.

### [2] Replicate data tier

The most difficult part of a multi-region application is typically data synchronization. Now that you have a separate stack in the Secondary region, we need to set up DynamoDB so that it automatically replicates any data created using the app in the primary region.

There's an easy way to do this - [DynamoDB Global Tables](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/global-tables/). This feature will ensure we always have a copy of our data in both our primary and failover region by continuously replicating changes using [DynamoDB Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html). We'll set this up now.

1. Open up the [DynamoDB console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) and ensure the region selected is your Primary region
2. Select **Tables** from the menu on the left and select the table **mm-ddbtable**

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69709325-0a39ba80-10b2-11ea-82a7-b07e69840e28.png)

3. Select the tab marked **Global Tables** and then press **Enable Streams**. Press **Enable** at the next prompt. Wait for this to complete (about 2 mins).

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69709422-33f2e180-10b2-11ea-851c-a46b5b6075be.png)

4. Add the Secondary region by selecting **Add region**, select the Secondary region from the list and click **Create replica**. *If you receive an error during this phase, try the Add replica step again - this error may occue if step 3 has not completed fully*.

    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69709749-df039b00-10b2-11ea-8cc8-c636c9346514.png)

5. The replica will take a few minutes to create and populate in the Secondary region. While this is happening, you can proceed to the next step.

<details>
  <summary>Learn more: What did I just do?</summary><br>

  You have just converted a regional DynamoDB table to a Global DynamoDB table. Doing this will automatically replicate the items in the table to any region that has a replica table configured using the above process. This ensures that our database tier (our DynamoDB table in this case) will remain in sync between the regions and is both writable and readable from any region that has a replica configured.

  * [Blog - converting a Single-Regional DynamoDB table to a Global Table](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-convert-your-single-region-amazon-dynamodb-tables-to-global-tables/)
  * [DynamoDB Core Components](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html)
  * [DynamoDB Global Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GlobalTables.html)
</details>

### [3] Replicate deployment infrastructure

Now that you have all your artifacts replicated into the secondary region, you can automate the deployments too. The CICD infrastructure is already provisioned for you. To automate the deployments into the secondary region, we'll use [AWS CodePipeline's Cross-Region Actions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/aws-codepipeline-now-supports-cross-region-actions/). This lets you see all your deployments across both regions in one place.

<details>
<summary>Learn more: Deployment pipeline options</summary><br>

You may be thinking. Why didn't we create a deployment pipeline in the secondary region? This is one way of doing things. Having a single pipeline in one region lets you ensure your application is consistent in both regions. With this method, you can still roll back to previous deployments manually in the event that there's an issue in the primary and you want to do that.

Isolation could also be another reason to have a second pipeline in a second region, but what you should think about is risk. How will you also deploy to the primary region? What if there's an outage? Do you want to be triggering deployments at that time? Inconsistent states are what you want to avoid, and this is one of the challenges with multi-region applications.
</details>

1. Navigate to the [CodePipeline console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline) of the **PRIMARY** region. Click on the pipeline that starts with *Core*. Note that if your pipelines are not in a **Succeeded** state, there was a problem. Try to get your deployments into a **Succeeded** state before proceeding. You may have to re-run some setup scripts.

    ![Select Core Pipeline](images/03-codepipeline-core.png)

2. Click on **Edit** and **Add stage** after the Deploy stage.

    ![Edit Core {Pipeline}](images/03-codepipeline-edit.png)

3. Type in `CrossRegionDeploy` for the stage name.

    ![Edit Core {Pipeline}](images/03-codepipeline-cross-region-deploy.png)

4. Next we will configure the stage so that it deploys to ECS in the secondary region. In the new CrossRegionDeploy stage, click **Add Action Group**. Enter in the following details in the **Edit Action** popup:

    **Edit Action**:
    * Click on **Add Action Group** and enter the following details:
    * Action name: **CrossRegionDeploy**
    * Action provider: **Amazon ECS**
    * Region: **Choose the secondary region you deployed into** - By default, this should be US East - (N. Virginia)
    * Input artifacts: **BuildArtifact**
    * Cluster name: **Choose the cluster that was created for you. It will start with Cluster-**
    * Service name: **Select the service that includes "Core"**
    * Image definitions file: **imagedefinitions_secondary.json** - The value of this will depend on what you output in your buildspec. Our default is imagedefinitions_secondary.json.

    ![Create Action](images/03-cp-createactiongroup.png)

5. Click **Done** and then **Save** at the top of the screen. Click through prompts until you're back at the pipeline. AWS CodePipeline will tell you that some resources will be updated. This is expected. Click **Save**.

    ![CodePipeline Update Source](images/03-codepipeline-update-cwe.png)

    At this point, you should see your pipeline again and the final stage will be grey because it has not run yet.

    ![CodePipeline Not Deployed](images/03-codepipeline-not-deployed.png)

6. **Do this again for the Like Service**
    <details>
    <summary>Hint: Click here for screenshots and expected values:</summary>

    ![Do it again](images/03-codepipeline-like.png)

    **Edit Action**:
    * Click on **Add Action Group** and enter the following details:
    * Action name: **CrossRegionDeploy**
    * Action provider: **Amazon ECS**
    * Region: **Choose the secondary region you deployed into** - By default, this should be US East - (N. Virginia)
    * Input artifacts: **BuildArtifact**
    * Cluster name: **Choose the cluster that was created for you. It will start with Cluster-**
    * Service name: **Select the service that includes "Like"**
    * Image definitions file: **imagedefinitions_secondary.json** - The value of this will depend on what you output in your buildspec. Our default is imagedefinitions_secondary.json.

    ![Do it again with the like](images/03-cp-createactiongroup-like.png)
    </details>

### [4] Replicate build artifacts

There are a number of ways to replicate your artifacts to another region. For S3, we could use [S3 Cross Region Replication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html), for ECR, there are solutions like the [Amazon ECR repositories cross-region replication solution](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ecr-cross-region-replication). There's also a [feature request](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/140) with the ECR team. In this case, we will update our build scripts to push the same Docker container to another region. In the previous section, we automated the deployments into another region and as part of the workshop initialization, we gave you the application for both **core** and **like** services. We will now have to update the buildspec_prod.yml file of both services to upload the container images to the secondary region.

<details>
  <summary>Learn more: What is a buildspec file?</summary><br>

  In this workshop, we created an [AWS CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) stage that calls [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/),  which is a fully managed continuous integration service that compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.

  AWS CodeBuild uses a definition file called a buildspec yaml file. The contents of the buildspec will determine what AWS actions CodeBuild should perform. The key parts of the buildspec are Environment Variables, Phases, and Artifacts. See [Build Specification Reference for AWS CodeBuild](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html).

</details>

You have (2) options at this point:

1. Follow the steps below, using the provided documentation (and hints if you get stuck), to add lines of instrumentation code to the Like service. If you go this route, try not spend more than 5 min on each step if you're at an AWS event with a time limit. We want you to be able to get through as many of the labs as possible.

    OR

2. Run the `bootstrap/secondary-region/setup` script. If you're short on time or would rather focus on the traffic management bits later in the workshop, reveal and follow the Option 2 step by step below.

**Choose your adventure!**

<details>
<summary>Option 1: Step-by-step manual instructions</summary>

First, we will update the **core-service** app.

1. Navigate to the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) of the secondary region. Click on your stack and go to the **Outputs** tab. Jot down in your notepad the values of:
    - SecondaryRegion
    - SecondaryLikeServiceEcrRepo
    - SecondaryCoreServiceEcrRepo

2. Within Cloud9, find the **core-service** CodeCommit repo. We can do this in the side navigation pane or via CLI.

    Console:
    ![Find file on nav pane](images/03-core-service_buildspec.png)

    CLI:
    ```
    $ cd ~/environment/core-service-[PRESS TAB TO AUTO COMPLETE AND PRESS ENTER]
    ```

3. Find the **buildspec_prod** file and open it. Within the file, you will see a number of [TODO] lines. Effectively, we are looking to replicate what we did for the primary region into the secondary region. In this case, one of our interns wasn't able to finish this before their intership ended, so you'll have to:
   * Assign **SecondaryCoreServiceEcrRepo** that you copied down in step 1 to **SECONDARY_CORE_REPO_URI**
   * Assign **SecondaryRegion** that you copied down in step 1 to **SECONDARY_REGION**
   * Tag the already built container to use the secondary region's ECR repo - Make sure you still use the **CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION**
   * Log into ECR in the secondary region
   * Push the image to the secondary region
   * Output an **imagedefinitions_secondary.json** file

   The buildspec file has a number of hints and links to help you figure out what to do.

   <details>
   <summary>Hint: What is this buildspec file doing and what, exactly are you updating?</summary>

   * In the **pre_build** section assigns a number of variables that we will use later on.
   * In the **build** section, this is where AWS CodeBuild is actually going to build the container. `docker build -t core-service:$CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION .` will build a docker container named core-service and tagged with the **CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION**. The **CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION** is a unique tag for the container image and in this case, is the commit ID as the commit is coming from CodeCommit. See AWS [CodeBuild Environment Variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-env-vars.html) for more information.
   * In the **post-build** section, AWS CodeBuild will push the images to an ECR repo. First it has to log in to ECR, then push the previous image. Afterwards, it outputs a file named **imagedefinitions_primary.json**. This file is to instruct AWS CodePipeline in the next stage, what to deploy. Specifically, what container to replace. In our case, we will be replacing the container named 'service' with the new container image that we just built. So it will output a json file with the contents `[{"name":"service","imageUri":"YourContainer:YourTag"}]`. In the secondary region, we named the file **imagedefinitions_secondary.json**.
   * Finally, in the **artifacts** section, AWS CodeBuild will output some files into a Zip file for AWS CodePipeline or any other service to consume. In our case, we are outputting a file called **imagedefinitions_primary.json** for AWS CodePipeline to consume. In this portion of the lab, we will also need to output an **imagedefinitions_secondary.json**.

   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Final Hint: We recommend that you don't spend more than 5-10 minutes on this. Click here for the answer.</summary>

   * If you're spending more than 5 to 10 minutes updating the buildspec file, we'd recommend coming back to this at a later time on your own as the fun part of the workshop is still to come! Hence, at this point, we'd recommend running the automated bootstrap script for the second region. To do this, scroll down a bit until you see **Option 2: Run the automated secondary region bootstrap script**

   * If you're adamant on just getting hints and not using automation, take a look at the hint file for the core buildspec [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-multi-region-bc-dr-workshop/blob/master/app/hints/core-buildspec_prod.yml). That will show you the answers without any values filled in.
   </details>

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the **like** service. Remember, at any time, you can follow option 2 and run the automated secondary region bootstrap script below. Note that there's a separate **like** service hint file.

5. Finally, add all the files to both repos and trigger new deployments:

    ```  
    $ cd ~/environment/core-service-[PRESS TAB TO AUTO COMPLETE AND PRESS ENTER]
    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m "Updating core buildspec for multi-region deploy"
    $ git push origin master
    $ cd ~/environment/like-service-[PRESS TAB TO AUTO COMPLETE AND PRESS ENTER]
    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m "Updating like buildspec for multi-region deploy"
    $ git push origin master
    ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Option 2: Run the automated secondary region bootstrap script</summary>

1. Navigate back to the [AWS Cloud9 console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9) and access your working environment if you're not already there. Run these commands:

    ```
    $ cd ~/environment/aws-multi-region-bc-dr-workshop
    $ bootstrap/secondary-region/setup
    ```

</details>
<br />
The last step of both of the options above will commit and push your new application code. Take a look at your pipelines in the AWS CodePipeline Console and you should see the deployments start. Wait until all deployments are complete.

![finished cp deploy multi-region](images/03-codepipeline-complete.png)

### [5] Enabling CloudWatch Dashboard to show multi-region metrics

Now that you have deployed the stack in the secondary region, lets adjust the CloudWatch dashboard that you created in the previous lab to include these new resources. This will provide visibility to the Core and Like services running across both regions on the same dashboard.

You have (2) options at this point:

Run the `bootstrap/dashboard/setup` script. This will deploy a fully prepared CloudWatch dashboard for you showing metrics from both stacks in both regions. If you're short on time or would rather focus on the traffic management bits later in the workshop, reveal and follow the Option 1 step by step below.

  OR

Follow the steps below, using the provided documentation (and hints if you get stuck), to add the additional metrics to the CloudWatch dashboard manually. If you go this route, try not spend more than 5 min on each step if you're at an AWS event with a time limit. We want you to be able to get through as many of the labs as possible.

**Choose your adventure!**

<details>
 <summary>Option 1: Use the script to build the dashboard</summary>

1. In the Cloud9 IDE terminal window, navigate to the root of the working directory that was cloned from Github.

    ```
    $ cd ~/environment/aws-multi-region-bc-dr-workshop
    ```    

2. Run the dashboard setup script to launch a Cloudformation template that will build the dashboard for you.

    ```
    $ bootstrap/dashboard/setup
    ```

3. Wait until you see **Successfully created/updated stack - Fully-Prepared-Dashboard**. This should take less than 30 seconds. Once complete, you can navigate to the [CloudWatch Dashboards](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?#dashboards:) page where you will see a new dashboard with **Fully-Prepared-Dashboard** in the name. You can use this going forward and modify it as you wish to.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69702002-15d1b500-10a3-11ea-9e4f-86ba53e69054.png)

<summary>Option 2: Step-by-step manual instructions</summary>

### 5. Edit the widgets to show metrics from the secondary region

With Amazon CloudWatch, we have the ability to stack metrics on top of each other in a widget that contains a graph. This will be useful in our case where we are viewing the same metric type, over two resources. We'll do this in the steps below in addition to adding the metrics from the other region.

Hint - see documentation for [Editing a Graph on a CloudWatch Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/edit_graph_dashboard.html)

## a. Edit the ALB widgets

As we are now adding in metrics from two different regions, we must navigate to the secondary region and load the dashboard from there. This is because when referring to metrics within a dashboard, CloudWatch can only see resources local to that region.

Modify the ALB Requests Per Minute widget to show the metrics from the ALB in the secondary region:

* Open up the [CloudWatch Dashboards](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) page and select the dashboard from the previous lab
* Change the region (top right of screen) to your Secondary region
* Add in the **RequestCount** metric for the ALB in the secondary region (default us-east-1)
* Add in the **ALB 2XX, 4XX and 5XX** metrics for the ALB in the secondary region (default us-east-1)
* Change the metric labels to identify the correct region for specified metric

<details>
    <summary>Hint with screenshots:</summary>

* Hover over the widget and select Edit in the top right hand corner

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69710628-951bb480-10b4-11ea-9a0c-ca8e8b603030.png)
* Select the All Metrics tab -> ApplicationELB -> Per AppELB Metrics and add in the **requestcount** metric from the ALB
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69883408-f09e9b80-1288-11ea-9605-79c0969666d8.png)
* Select Graphed Metrics and change the label to match the region
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69883467-3196b000-1289-11ea-884d-5cce782fe962.png)
* Click **Update widget**
    </details>

Modify the ALB HTTP Responses widget to show the metrics from the ALB in the secondary region:

* Add in the **HTTP 2XX / 4XX / 5XX Count** metrics from the ALB. *Note: you may not see all the metrics above available to select, this is as the metric only becomes available after the Load Balancer has seen these types of errors. If this is the case then move on as you can always come back and add the missing metric later.*
* Change the metric labels to identify the correct region for that metric
* Ensure the region you put in the label matches the region in the details
* Click **Update widget**

<details>

</details>


## b. Add widgets for the Like and Core Services from Secondary region

Add a new widget for each of the Like and Core services running in the secondary region. This will allow you to view the Service metrics across both regions. To do this, follow these steps from within your CloudWatch dashboard:

* Click **Add widget**, select **Number** and press **Configure**
* Click the pencil next to *Untitled graph*, type in `us-east-1 Core Service Metrics` and press Enter
* From the **All metrics** tab, select **ECS** and then **ClusterName, ServiceName**
* Select the two metrics for **CPUUtilization** and **Memory Utilization** for the **Core** Service
* Click the tab marked **Graphed metrics** and change the statistic period to 1 Minute for both metrics
* Click Create widget
* Move this new widget into place under the others of the same type
* Repeat the above steps to create another widget, this time for the **Like** service

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69884310-9c95b600-128c-11ea-9516-97727607869e.png)

<details>
 <summary>Hint with screenshots:</summary>

 * Click **Add widget**, select **Number** and press **Configure**

 * Click the pencil next to *Untitled graph*, type in `us-east-1 Core Service Metrics` and press Enter
 * From the **All metrics** tab, select **ECS** and then **ClusterName, ServiceName**
 * Select the two metrics for **CPUUtilization** and **Memory Utilization** for the **Core** Service

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69911993-4766bb00-13d8-11ea-8ada-77314c809956.png)

* Click the tab marked **Graphed metrics** and change the statistic period to 1 Minute for both metrics

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23423809/69911965-e808ab00-13d7-11ea-8960-189e789a1e3a.png)

* Click Create widget

 </details>

* Repeat the above steps to create another widget, this time for the **Like** service.

Feel free to move the widgets around the dashboard to suit your style following the instructions in the [CloudWatch documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/move_resize_graph_dashboard.html).
Youc can drag widgets around and move them into position wherever you like. You can also add a text widget to show a title, include links to a knowledgebase wiki or internal tooling. Get creative!


## c. Add X-Ray groupings to capture faults and errors

Refer back to [Lab 1, section 5](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-multi-region-bc-dr-workshop/tree/master/lab-1-xray#5-reduce-the-signal-from-the-noise) for instructions on how to implement X-Ray filter expressions. Just make sure that you’re in the secondary region when creating the groups within the X-Ray console.


## d. Update X-Ray widget on CloudWatch dashboard to show faults and errors metrics

Modify the X-Ray widget on the CloudWatch dashboard to include X-Ray metrics from the secondary region. To do this, follow these steps from within your CloudWatch dashboard:

* Hover over the top of the X-Ray widget and select and select Edit in the top right corner
* From the **All metrics** tab, select **X-Ray**, then **Group Metrics**
* Select the tickbox for the metric with **like-service-errors-faults** in the GroupName
* Click Update widget

<details>
    <summary>Hint with screenshots:</summary>

* Hover over the top of the X-Ray widget and select and select Edit in the top right corner
